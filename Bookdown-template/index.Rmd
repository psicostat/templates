# Prerequisites {-}

This is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

The **bookdown** package can be installed from CRAN or Github:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("bookdown")
# or the development version
# devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
```

Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading `#`.

To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.name/tinytex/>.

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```

## Psicostat Template {-}

Psicostat Template is based on [Rstudio Bookdown-demo](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown-demo) released under [CC0-1.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) and [rstudio4edu-book](https://rstudio4edu.github.io/rstudio4edu-book/) under [CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/).


## Deploy Github Actions {-}

Follow tutorial at https://medium.com/@delucmat/how-to-publish-bookdown-projects-with-github-actions-on-github-pages-6e6aecc7331e but note that github action https://github.com/Cecilapp/GitHub-Pages-deploy is slightly changed so we adapted de code. In particular now we have as last action:

```
- name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
       uses: Cecilapp/GitHub-Pages-deploy@v3
       env:
         GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
       with:
         email: ${{ secrets.EMAIL }}
         build_dir: _site/
```

Moreover, we also installed `tinytex` and specified `rmarkdown::render_site(encoding = "UTF-8")` in the first job to obtain pdf and epub available versions as well.


## HTML and LaTeX {-}

Remember that as the output is compiled to create a website and a PDF you have to take care of defining options and environments in both cases. See official documeentation https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/
